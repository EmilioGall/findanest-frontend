## API

The FindAnest Frontend utilizes the following APIs:

- **Patient API**: For retrieving patient information and booking consultations.
- **Anesthesiologist API**: For retrieving anesthesiologist availability and scheduling consultations.

### Example

```javascript
axios.get('https://example.com/patient/api/patients')
  .then(response => {
    const patients = response.data;
    // Use patient data to populate the consultation calendar
  });
```

## Milestones

### Milestone 1
Create a reusable component containing a search bar and a calendar for patients to book appointments.

### Milestone 2
Integrate the Patient API to fetch patient information and populate the consultation calendar.

### Milestone 3
Implement functionality that triggers an API call whenever a patient searches for an anesthesiologist, returning a list of available options.

### Milestone 4

### Bonus 1
Integrate with existing PMS systems for seamless data transfer.

### Bonus 2
Implement advanced search filters for patients to narrow down their search results.

### Bonus 3
Add a notification system for patients to receive reminders about upcoming consultations.
